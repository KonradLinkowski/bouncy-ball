# Canvas

The Canvas API is a web browser feature for rendering 2D graphics on the web, introduced as part of the HTML5 spec.

Working with canvas involves using the `<canvas>` HTML element and various JavaScript APIs to manipulate pixels on the canvas drawing surface.

Canvas graphics aren't represented in [the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction), which reduces rendering overhead but also leaves the graphics inaccessible to screen readers. As a result, canvas is usually reserved for use-cases like animations, games, data visualization, drawing tools, and photo manipulation.
